                <p>This project aims to teach a robot to autonomously learn and reverse complex tasks using Behavior Trees (BT), Learning from Demonstration (LfD), and 6D Pose Estimation.</p>

                <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            </header>
            <p><strong>Behavior Trees (BT):</strong> A modular and scalable control architecture widely used in robotics for decision-making and execution of actions. BTs allow flexible and hierarchical task handling, which is critical for autonomous systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Learning from Demonstration (LfD):</strong> A technique where robots learn tasks by observing and imitating the actions demonstrated by humans. This is particularly useful for robotic assembly tasks that require flexibility and precision.</p>
            <p><strong>Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP):</strong> A robust framework that allows robots to encode and reproduce smooth, nonlinear trajectories learned from demonstrations. DMPs ensure global asymptotic stability and adaptability in dynamic environments.</p>

            </header>
            <p><strong>Robotic Arm:</strong> Franka Emika Panda, a high-precision manipulator with 7 degrees of freedom, integrated torque sensors, and ROS compatibility.</p>
            <p><strong>Camera:</strong> Intel RealSense D435i, providing 3D vision and depth perception for accurate object tracking.</p>
            <p><strong>Custom Board:</strong> A modular surface for robotic manipulation, inspired by NIST, equipped with Aruco markers for precise tracking.</p>

                <h2>System Architecture</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The system consists of a robot manipulator, camera, and modular board for manipulation tasks. The Franka Emika Panda robot interacts with objects on the board, while the Intel RealSense D435i camera provides real-time depth and object recognition data. ROS (Robot Operating System) coordinates the actions.</p>

                <h2>Implementation</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The robot learns to perform tasks via Learning from Demonstration. Through teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, the robot records demonstrated actions, extracts key features, and uses these to replicate the task autonomously. DMPs enable the robot to adapt movements to new goals while maintaining stability.</p>
